# Functional-programming

> *“We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit.”* – Will Durant (paraphrasing Aristotle)

This repository contains my personal notes and solutions to exercises from various Haskell books and courses. It also includes my solutions to past functional programming exams.

The repository is actively evolving as I continue learning and refining my solutions.
