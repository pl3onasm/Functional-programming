## Exercise 18.1

Trace the evaluation of the following expressions, taking into account that Haskell is a lazy language.

---

### 18.1.1

```haskell
head (from 1)
```

#### Evaluation

Using the definitions:

```haskell
from :: Integer -> [Integer]
from m = m : from (m + 1)

head :: [a] -> a
head (x : _) = x
```

We get:

```haskell
head (from 1)
=> head (1 : from 2)
=> 1
```

Only the head is evaluated due to laziness. The tail `from 2` is unevaluated.

---

### 18.1.2

```haskell
length (take 3 (from 0))
```

#### Evaluation

Definitions:

```haskell
take :: Integer -> [a] -> [a]
take n _ | n <= 0 = []
take n (x : xs) = x : take (n - 1) xs

length :: [a] -> Integer
length [] = 0
length (_ : xs) = 1 + length xs
```

Tracing step-by-step:

```haskell
length (take 3 (from 0))
=> length (0 : take 2 (from 1))
=> 1 + length (take 2 (from 1))
=> 1 + 1 + length (take 1 (from 2))
=> 1 + 1 + 1 + length (take 0 (from 3))
=> 1 + 1 + 1 + 0
=> 3
```

Only the first 3 elements of `from 0` are ever evaluated.

---

### 18.1.3

```haskell
reverse [1, 2, 3]
```

Definition of `reverse`:

```haskell
reverse :: [a] -> [a]
reverse [] = []
reverse (x : xs) = reverse xs ++ [x]
```

Tracing step-by-step:

```haskell
reverse [1, 2, 3]
=> reverse [2, 3] ++ [1]
=> (reverse [3] ++ [2]) ++ [1]
=> ((reverse [] ++ [3]) ++ [2]) ++ [1]
=> (([] ++ [3]) ++ [2]) ++ [1]
=> ([3] ++ [2]) ++ [1]
=> [3, 2] ++ [1]
=> [3, 2, 1]
```

Since the whole list is needed, full evaluation occurs.

---

### 18.1.4

```haskell
(&&) True (1 == 0)
```

Definition:

```haskell
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True && x = x
False && _ = False
```

Tracing:

```haskell
True && (1 == 0)
=> 1 == 0
=> False
```

Since the first operand is `True`, the second one is evaluated. This would be different if the first operand were `False`, as it would short-circuit the evaluation.

---

### 18.1.5

```haskell
(&&) (1 == 0) (fibo !! 10 == 0)
```

Definition:

```haskell
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True && x = x
False && _ = False
```

Tracing:

```haskell
(1 == 0) => False
False && _ => False
```

Due to short-circuiting, `fibo !! 10 == 0` is never evaluated.
