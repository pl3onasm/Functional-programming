A Hilbert space is a complete inner product space, 
which generalizes the notion of Euclidean space to 
possibly infinite dimensions. It provides the 
framework for the mathematical formulation of 
quantum mechanics, signal processing, and more.

Key properties include the existence of orthonormal 
bases, the projection theorem, and the Riesz 
representation theorem. Hilbert spaces enable 
techniques like Fourier analysis and support the 
study of operators in functional analysis.
